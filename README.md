# Dynamics 365 - Audit Publish & PublishAll messages

Based on a question that I found in [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39265795/crm-plugin-for-publish-and-publish-all-messages/39291051) I did a little test to see how the Publish & PublishAll messages work and to discover what information is available to audit them using a plugin:

![Message audited](https://i0.wp.com/www.fedejousset.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/publish_log.png "Message audited")

[For more information on this example, please refer to the original blog post.](http://www.fedejousset.com/2017/03/13/audit-publish-publishall-events/)
